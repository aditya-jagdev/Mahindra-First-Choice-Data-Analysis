## Brief Overview

* Mahindra First Choice Services (MFCS) is a multi-brand car workshop that has its outlets spread across India. MFCS wants to carry out customer segmentation and derive any actionable insights from its data dump.
* The data provided contained 6% outliers. The criteria for outliers was set to cars that have greater than 300,000 KM odometer reading.
* Revenue generation from different types of customers across different features were plotted.

### Key Takeaways

* MFCS should focus marketing resources on selling SMC Value Packages as it has by far the maximum revenue per each job hour.
* MFCS should offer customers to buy their vehicles at around 80,000 KM odometer reading as this is the most likely time when most people who sell their vehicles sell them.
* Using these second hand vehicles to sell to other businesses as parts of fleets along with service packages will open new revenue streams.
